By utilizing an open database of FitBit user data (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) I transformed to information into visualizations to deteremine user trends of smart devices for wellness. This project is in tandem with the Google Data Analyst Certification course and is the capstone project for this course. Feel free to use this data as you see fit!
